# 0. Given the following operations:
#      - all : takes a list of booleans, and returns true if every
#              element is true, but false otherwise,
#      - any : takes a list of booleans, and returns true if any
#              element is true, and false otherwise.
#    Using the above operations and a list comprehension determine 
#    if every element of a list of integers, called ints, is
#    greater than 4.

# 2. The four-queens problem asks that one place four queens on a
#    4x4-chessboard so that no two queens are attacking each
#    other.  Convert the following board into a list of lists:

#    |*|*|*|Q|

# 3. Suppose we are given a board called board.
#    There is a row in board with two queens.

# 4. Do the same,Â but Determine if two queens are
#    in the same coloumn.

# 5. Ditto, but determine if two queens are in the same
#    diagonal.
